<h1>About What Would Bayliss Say?</h1>

	<p>
		What Would Bayliss Say? was built by <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/MCHLWRRN">Michael Warren</a> - an Umphrey's fan on a mission to spread the word of our savior, Mr. Brendan Bayliss.
	</p>
	<p>
		We're all in need of some direction that you can't find through instrospection. Thankfully, we have the words of Bayliss to offer guidance in times of confusion and uncertainty.

			Since he started seeing Umphrey's in 2006, Michael has spent countless hours obsessing over the pursuit of the jams. Whether it's on the road following them accross the country or with a pair of headphones analyzing UMLives for the quintessential improv, the dedication is never in question.
